# GoTodoCLI

A simple CLI to manage Todo tasks using Golang

## Run
It is a console application, just need to install it with Go or just call the .exe

`$ GoTodoCLI`

## Before Run
Create a folder called `gotodocli` and add a file called `config`, use any extension that you like (e.g. toml, yaml, etc...)

There is no need to add any information to run the application, with the empty file is enough, but if you want, you can custom the config as you like

## config
The config file will automatically be filled with all the variables needed, if you are interested in changing anything to follow you preferences, just run once and change as the way you like, always respecting the data type of the variable

That's it, suit yourself
